# SoundCloudScape

SoundScape aims to be an audio to landscape/gameplay abstraction. <br>
Part music visualiser part simple game kit.

##Roadmap
Currently everything is entangled and the gameplay is set. The the decoupling process is underway.

The intention is to provide an interface to build a game around waveforms, collision detection, player control, custom game events on playback cue and more.

##Origins
Originally conceived as a small experiment to reproduce the classic flash helicopter game of old [see example](http://www.helicoptergame.net/).
It uses the peaks of the audio track to create the cave/cavern the "helicopter" must navigate during playback.

##Built using
[p5js](http://p5js.org/) and [p5.collide2d](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D)
